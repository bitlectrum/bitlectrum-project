Bitlectrum seeks to pull the coin lending system community from marginalized to mainstream by builing blockchain into every step of the lending system
industry and by working toward full legalization. Our strength lies in the unique blockchain/lending system connection that uses smart contracts. We believe in
we are lending system, and we believe in the benefits. More uses of lending system are coming to light, and we want to accelerate that process. We are passionate
about moving forward in an ethical, morally responsible, and legal way. Why did we choose the name of Bitlectrum? Because bitcoin history “exceptional”
and that is what we aspire to be.
